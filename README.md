Drum Audio Notation Generator
Python Streamlit License
A web-based application built with Streamlit that processes drum audio recordings (WAV format) and generates drum notation in a style inspired by the "Master Drum Key." The app detects drum hits, classifies them into user-specified drum types, and produces a text-based notation that aligns with standard drum notation practices.

Overview
The Drum Audio Notation Generator is designed for drummers, music producers, and educators who want to transcribe drum patterns from audio recordings into readable notation. The app uses audio processing techniques (via librosa) to detect drum hits and maps them to a user-defined set of drums, producing notation that follows the "Master Drum Key" style. Users can customize the BPM and specify which drums are present in the audio to ensure accurate transcription.
Features
Audio Upload: Upload drum audio files in WAV format.

BPM Customization: Set the BPM manually or use an estimated BPM (via librosa).

Drum Selection: Specify which drums are present in the audio (e.g., Bass 1, Snare, Hi-hat) to improve classification accuracy.

Drum Notation: Generates text-based drum notation in 4/4 time with 16th-note resolution, using symbols from the Master Drum Key (e.g., "o" for snare, "x" for hi-hat).

Waveform Visualization: Displays the audio waveform with detected drum hits marked.

Download Notation: Save the generated notation as a text file.

Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/drum-audio-notation-generator.git
cd drum-audio-notation-generator

Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

The requirements.txt should include:

streamlit>=1.0.0
librosa>=0.9.0
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
scipy>=1.7.0

Run the Application:
bash

streamlit run app.py

This will launch the app in your default web browser.

Usage
Launch the App:
Run the app using the command above. A browser window will open with the Streamlit interface.

Upload an Audio File:
Click the "Upload a drum audio file (WAV format)" button and select a WAV file containing a drum recording.

Set the BPM:
The app will display an estimated BPM (calculated using librosa).

Use the number input field to set the desired BPM (between 30 and 300), or keep the estimated value.

Select Drums:
Use the multi-select dropdown to choose the drums present in the audio (e.g., Bass 1, Snare, Hi-hat).

You must select at least one drum to proceed.

Process the Audio:
Click the "Process Audio" button to analyze the audio and generate the notation.

The app will display the detected drum pattern as text-based notation, a waveform with marked drum hits, and a download button for the notation.

Example Output
For an audio file with a simple rock beat (Bass 1, Snare, Hi-hat) at 124 BPM, the output might look like:

Drum Notation (4/4, 16th note resolution, BPM: 124.0):

Bass 1       | o--- ---- ---- ---- 
Snare        | ---- o--- ---- o--- 
Hi-hat       | x-x- x-x- x-x- x-x- 

Symbols: "o" for drums like Bass 1 and Snare, "x" for cymbals like Hi-hat (as per the Master Drum Key).

Timing: Each group of four characters represents a quarter note, with 16th-note resolution.

Limitations
Drum Classification: The app uses a simple amplitude-based heuristic to classify drum hits (e.g., high amplitude for Bass 1, medium for Snare, low for Hi-hat). This may lead to misclassifications, especially for complex recordings.

Fixed Time Signature: Currently supports only 4/4 time with 16th-note resolution.

No Modifiers: Does not yet support notation modifiers (e.g., ghost notes, accents, rolls) from the Master Drum Key.

Audio Quality: Performance depends on the clarity of the audio. Noisy or mixed recordings may result in inaccurate hit detection.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

Potential improvements:
Add support for different time signatures.

Improve drum classification using frequency analysis or machine learning.

Include notation modifiers (e.g., ghost notes, accents).

Add a preview feature to help users identify drums in the audio.

Notes:
File Structure: The README.md assumes the project has a single app.py file (the current script) and a requirements.txt file. If your project has additional files (e.g., a separate LICENSE file), make sure they exist in the repository.

Customization: You can adjust the repository URL (https://github.com/your-username/drum-audio-notation-generator.git) to match your actual repository.

Badges: The badges at the top (Python, Streamlit, License) are optional but add a professional touch. You can customize them or add more using a badge generator like shields.io.
